## Scope — What counts as a vulnerability?

Since this add-on uses the Minecraft Script API
(**`@minecraft/server` 2.9.0** and **`@minecraft/server-ui` 2.1.0**), the
following are considered security issues:

- Malicious or unintended behavior in any of the scripts
  (`Registry.js`, `ArmorSystem`, `DurabilitySystem`, etc.)
- Scripts that could corrupt a player's world or cause unintended
  data loss
- Exploits in the `ConverterSystem` or `LoreSystem` that allow
  item duplication or unintended game mechanics
- Any file (JSON or script) that could harm the user's device or
  Minecraft world

## Out of Scope — What does NOT count?

- Gameplay bugs or balance issues
- Recipe or crafting inconsistencies
- Crashes caused by incompatible add-on combinations
- Feature requests or suggestions

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is confirmed, we will:
1. Work on a fix as soon as possible
2. Release a patched version
3. Credit the reporter (if desired)
